# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure!

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please report it **responsibly and privately**.

**Preferred method (recommended - stays private until fixed):**
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
  - Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
  - Click **"Report a vulnerability"**

This ensures the issue remains confidential until resolved.

**Alternative methods:**
- Send me a private message on GitHub

Please **do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have addressed it.

Your help is greatly appreciated!
